# Hi, I'm Anastasia 👋

I'm a backend-focused C# developer who builds and deploys real-world services.

I enjoy working on projects that combine:
- backend logic
- web scraping
- APIs
- and real production deployment on Linux servers.

## 🚀 Featured Project

### 📚 FanficDownloader — Telegram Bot

A production Telegram bot that lets users download fanfiction from multiple websites and receive it as EPUB or TXT files directly in Telegram.

🔗 **Live bot:** https://t.me/YourBotUsername  
📦 **Repository:** https://github.com/nornan01/FanficDownloader  

**What makes it interesting:**
- Runs 24/7 on a Linux VPS using `systemd`
- Uses a Dockerized FlareSolverr service to bypass Cloudflare on Fanfiction.net
- Modular multi-source scraping architecture
- Generates real EPUB files, not just text
